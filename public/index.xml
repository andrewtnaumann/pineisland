      <description>“You surf in Lake Michigan?!” Three years ago, I rented a board on a whim from a local shop. The 75 degree, clear late summer day reminded me of far away tropical places like Hawaii and Puerto Rico. I was hooked. Five surfboards, two wetsuits, and many many snowy surf session later, I wanted a way to predict and notify of surf, but better.
Using real-time meteorological observations, I calculate and notify via SMS message when to surf in Lake Michigan.</description>

      <description>Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again. Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Hugo is a static site generator. Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you create or update your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Hugo is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience for your website’s end users and an ideal writing experience for website authors.</description>
