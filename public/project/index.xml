      <description>“You surf in Lake Michigan?!” Three years ago, I rented a board on a whim from a local shop. The 75 degree, clear late summer day reminded me of far away tropical places like Hawaii and Puerto Rico. I was hooked.

Using real-time meteorological observations, I calculate and notify via SMS message when to surf in Lake Michigan.</description>
